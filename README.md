In multilevel modeling (MLM), hypothesis tests of individual predictor fixed effects are routinely estimated and reported. For more complex, multiparameter fixed effects hypothesis tests, such as simultaneously testing the significance of a predictor main effect and its interaction with another predictor, two options exist: the general linear hypothesis test (GLHT) or the likelihood-ratio test (LRT). The comparison of two coefficients to each other as a slope-to-slope difference test for linear MLMs, however, has just recently been given attention by Sanders et al. (under review).The present study describes and demonstrates use of a novel MLM package in R, SlopeDiffTest, that can implement such pairwise slope difference tests while simultaneously controlling for Type I error inflation. Discussion around extensions of this package to other models will also be discussed.
